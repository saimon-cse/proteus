# Proteus Projects

Welcome to my repository of Proteus circuit designs! This collection includes various projects built using **Proteus**, a powerful tool for designing and simulating electronics. The projects featured here range from simple logic circuits to more complex digital systems. 

## Projects Overview

This repository contains different digital and analog circuit designs, simulations, and related files. Some of the common projects you will find here include:

- **Basic Logic Gates**: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR gates.
- **Adders and Subtractors**: Half adder, Full adder, Subtractor circuits.
- **Multiplexers and Decoders**: Basic data selectors and binary decoders.
- **Flip-Flops and Registers**: D flip-flop, JK flip-flop, and register designs.
- **Other Digital Circuits**: Counters, shift registers, and more.

Each folder typically contains the following files:
- **Proteus Simulation File (.dsn)**: The main Proteus project file.
- **Schematic Diagrams (if separate)**: In some cases, you may also find schematic diagrams in image formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).
- **Supporting Files**: Any additional resources, such as component datasheets, code (e.g., Arduino or PIC), or explanations of the design.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download**: You can either clone this repository or download the ZIP file containing the projects.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saimon-cse/proteus.git
